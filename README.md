# SimpleAuthNet

SimpleAuthNet is a free and open-source project intended to solve the headache
of getting user and role based authorization / authentication up and running
in your .NET WebApi and client application.

## Why SimpleAuthNet

- Implementing Auth generally sucks
- Alternative to Microsoft Identity
- Free alternative to expensive Identity Management for small to medium sized entities

## What does SimpleAuthNet offer?

The API offers two classifications of endpoints:

- Authentication / Registration / Password Reset - Public
- Administration Endpoints (Private) - Protected

The first version of this project uses Angular as a client application, but
it's hopeful that I'll get other client front ends up and running using the
WebApi as well including React, Vue, Blazor & ASP.NET MVC. Contributions of
other front-end clients is encouraged as well.
